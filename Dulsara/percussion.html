			<p>A percussion instrument is a musical instrument that is sounded by being struck or scraped by a beater including attached
			<br>or enclosed beaters or rattles struck, scraped or rubbed by hand or struck against another similar instrument.
			<br>Excluding zoomusicological instruments and the human voice, the percussion family
			<br> is believed to include the oldest musical instruments.<br>
			<br>The most common percussion instruments in the orchestra include the timpani, xylophone,
			<br>cymbals, triangle, snare drum, bass drum, tambourine, maracas, gongs, chimes, celesta, and piano.<br>
			<br>Percussion instruments are most commonly divided into two classes,
			<br>Pitched percussion instruments, which produce notes with an identifiable pitch, and unpitched 
			<br>percussion instruments, which produce notes or sounds in an indefinite pitch.

			<h2> Did You Know?</h2>
			
			<p>Percussion instruments may play not only rhythm, but also melody and harmony.<br>
			Percussion is commonly referred to as "the backbone" or "the heartbeat" of a musical ensemble,<br>
			often working in close collaboration with bass instruments, when present. In jazz and other popular
			<br>music ensembles, the pianist, bassist, drummer and sometimes the guitarist are referred to as the rhythm section.<br>
			Most classical pieces written for full orchestra <br>
			since the time of Haydn and Mozart are orchestrated to place emphasis on the strings, woodwinds, and brass. <br>
			However, often at least one pair of timpani is included, though they rarely play continuously.<br>
			 Rather, they serve to provide additional accents when needed.<br>
			In the 18th and 19th centuries, other percussion instruments <br>
			(like the triangle or cymbals) have been used, again generally sparingly.<br>
			The use of percussion instruments became more frequent in the 20th century classical music.<br>
			In almost every style of music, percussion plays a pivotal role.<br>In military marching bands and pipes and drums,<br>
			 it is the beat of the bass drum that keeps the soldiers in step and at a regular speed,<br>
			 and it is the snare that provides that crisp, decisive air to the tune of a regiment. </p>
