			<p>Keyboard instruments are any instruments played by depressing levers, buttons, 
			<br>or keys to produce sound. 
			<br>The most common of these instruments are the piano and organ, but there’s a wide variety
			<br>keyboard instruments in existence. 
			<br>Nearly all keyboard instruments, especially those associated with Western music, 
			have keys corresponding to 
			<br>notes in the chromatic scale and run from bass at the left side of the keyboard to treble at the right.
			<br>As one of the most versatile musical instrument families, keyboards have amassed great importance and popularity. 
			<br>The keyboard allows a performer to play several notes at once and in close succession to one another, 
			<br>a feat that few other instruments can accomplish. 
			<br>Because nearly any composition can be played on a keyboard, whether it’s chordal harmonies, a single melody or a
			<br>combination of the two, the keyboard has been utilized by nearly every major composer since the 16th century.</p>
