			<p>A wind instrument is a musical instrument that contains some type of resonator (usually a tube) in which a column 
			<br>of air is set into vibration by the player blowing into (or over) a mouthpiece set at or near the end of the resonator.
			<br>The pitch of the vibration is determined by the length of the tube and by manual
			<br>modifications of the effective length of the vibrating column of air.<br>
			<br><br>
			<br>In the case of some wind instruments, sound is produced by blowing through a reed; 
			<br> others require buzzing into a metal mouthpiece, 
			<br>while yet others require the player to blow into a hole at an edge, 
			<br>which splits the air column and creates the sound.

			<h2> Did You Know?</h2>
			
			<p>Wind instruments are typically grouped into two families:<br>
			<br>Brass instruments (horns, trumpets, trombones, euphoniums, and tubas)<br>
			Woodwind instruments (recorders, flutes, oboes, clarinets, saxophones, and bassoons)<br>
			<br>Although brass instruments were originally made of brass and woodwind instruments have traditionally been made of wood, <br>
			the names refer to the method by which a player produces sound rather than the <br>
			material of the instrument, which may vary. For example, the saxophone is typically made of brass, <br>
			but is classified as a woodwind instrument because it produces sound with a vibrating reed.<br>
			  On the other hand, the didgeridoo, the wooden cornett (not to be confused with the cornet, which is made of brass),<br>
			and the serpent are all made of wood (or plastic tubing, in the case of modern serpents), and the olifant <br>
			made from ivory, but all of them belong to the family of brass<br>
			 instruments because the vibrating is done by the player's lips.<br>
			<br>In brass instruments, the player's lips themselves vibrate, causing the air within the instrument to vibrate.<br> </p>
